# Features of C language
![[Pasted image 20220102234307.png]]

## Simple
- C is a simple language in the sense that it provides a **structural approach**(to break problem into parts),
- **The rich set of library functions, data types, etc.**


## Machine Independent or Portable
Unlike assembly language, C programs **can be executed on different machine** with some *machine specific changes*. Therefore, C is machine independent language.

## Mid-Level Programming Language

Although, C is **intended to do low-level programming language**. It is used to develop system applications such as kernel, drivers etc. It also supports the features of a **high-level programming language** that's why it is known as *Mid-level Programming Language*


## Structured Programming Language
C is structured programming language in the sense that **we can break a program  into parts using functions**. So it is easy to understand and modify. Functions also provide code **reusability**.

## Rich Library
C provides **a lot of inbuilt functions** that make the development fast.

## Memory Management
It supports the feature of **dynamic memory allocation**. In C language we can free the allocated memory at any time by the   **free()** function.

## Speed
The *compilation and execution* time of C language is fast since there are lesser inbuilt functions and hence the lesser overhead.

## Pointer
- C provides the feature of pointers. We can *directly interact with memory by using the pointers*.
- We can **use pointers for memory, structures, functions, array** etc.

## Recursion
- In C language, we can **call the function within the function**. 
- It provides code reusability for every function.
- Recursion enables us to use the approach of backtracking.

## Extensible
C language is extensible because it can **easily adopt new features**.
