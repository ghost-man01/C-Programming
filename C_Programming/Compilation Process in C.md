# What is a Compilation
The compilation is a process of *converting source code into object code.*

The compilation process divided into 4 steps :
- Pre-processing
- Compiling
- Assembling
- Linking

1. The Pre-processor takes the source code as a *Input*, and removes *all comments* from the source code.
2. The preprocessor takes the preprocessor directive and interprets it. For example, if <stdio.h>, the directive is available in the program then the preprocessor interprets the directive and replace this directive with the contents of *stdio.h*file.

The following are phases through which our program passes before being transferred into an executable form:

- Pre-Processor
- Compiler
- Assembler
- Linker

## Preprocessor
The source code file is given an extension '.c'. This source code passed to the preprocessor, and then **preprocessor expands the code**. After expanding the code, *the expanded code passed to the compiler.*

## Compiler
- The code which is expanded by the preprocessor is passed to the compiler.
- The compiler converts this code into **assembly code** or we can say that C compiler converts the pre-processed code into assembly code.

## Assembler
- *The assembly code converted into object code* by using an **assembler**.
- The name of the object file generated by the assembler is same as the source file.
- The name of the object file in DOS is *.obj* and in UNIX extension is *.o*

## Linker
- Mainly all the programs written in C use library functions.
- The library functions are pre-compiled, and the object code of these files is stored with *.lib* or *.a* extension 
- Linker combine the object code of library with the object code of our program.
- Sometimes situation arises when our programs refers to the functions defined in other files, then linker plays a very important role in this. It links the object code of these files to our program. *Conclusion* 
- **Job of a linker is to link the object code of our program with the object code of the library files and other files**.   
- In DOS(Disk Operating System), the extension of executable file is **.exe** and in UNIX an executable file can be named as **a.out**. 
- For example if we are using a printf() function then the link adds its associated code in an output file.
This file is **hello.c**
```C
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
	printf("Hello Ghost");
	return 0;
}
```
