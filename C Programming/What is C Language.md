# C Language
C language is created by **Denis Ritchie** for creating system applications that directly interact with the hardware devices such as **drivers, kernels, etc**

###### C language defined as following ways:
- Mother Language
- System Programming Language
- Procedure-oriented Programming Language
- Structured Programming Language
- Mid Level Programming Language

## C as Mother Language
C is considered as mother language of all the modern language because 
- **most of compilers, JVMs, Kernels etc. are written in C**.
- most of programming language following the syntax of the C  for example Java, C++, C#

##### It provides the concepts like :
- **arrays**
- **strings**
- **functions**
- **file handling**
- *That are being used in many languages like **C++, Java, C#, etc***

## C as System Programming Language
- A system programming language is used to create **System Software**.
- C is a system programming language because **It can be used to do low-level programming (for example : driver and Kernel)** 
- It is generally used to create **hardware devices, OS, Drivers, Kernel, etc.**
- Example **Linux Kernel written in C**
- It can't be used for Internet Programming Languages like : **Java, .Net, PHP**

## C as Procedural Language
A procedure is known as **function, method, routine, subroutine, etc. ** 
- A procedure language is **specifies a series of steps for the program to solve the problem**.
- A procedure language breaks the program into **functions and data structures etc.**
- C is procedural language. In C, **variables, function Prototype** *must be declared before being used*.

## C as structured Programming Language

- A structured Programming Language is a subset of procedural programming language.
- **Structure means to break a program into *parts or blocks***
- In C language we break the programs into parts using functions. It makes the program easier to understand and modify.

## C as a mid-level language
- C is considered as middle-level language because **it supports the feature of both low-level and high level languages.**
- C program is converted into assembly code, it supports *pointer arithmetic*(low-level), but it is **machine independent(a feature of high level)**
-  A **Low-level Language** is specific to one machine, i.e., **machine dependent**. It is machine dependent, fast to run. But it is not easy to understand.
- A **High-level Language** is not specific to one machine, i.e., machine independent. It is easy to understand.

```C
#indclude<stio.h>

int main(){
	
	printf("Hello C Programming\n");
	return 0;
}
```
